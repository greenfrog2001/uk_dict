{"Company brochure": "Hi Tom, \nI got your email dated November 10th regarding your company brochure. I am glad to hear that you liked my company brochure and I am happy to provide you with the information that you are seeking. The company which made my brochure is Tan Phan Design. They are pretty new, having been in the industry only 2 years. However, their attention to detail, creative approach (tiếp cận sáng tạo), and sincere desire to help customers (khát khao giúp khách hàng) convinced me to choose them over established companies. (cty lâu đời = old) I have attached the contact information of Tan Phan Design for your information. \nLet me know if you need more information. \nBest, \nPeter"
